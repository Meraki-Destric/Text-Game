# Text Game
 
 A simple project created by Joshua for their Project 3 at GA
 
 ### Project
 
 This is a basic test based game. At the time of writing this readme, it's still a prototype containing basic navigation throughout maps. It allows the creator to assign various custom maps that the player can explore, with each of the map tiles holding a piece of text that can be used to give players information about their surroundings.
